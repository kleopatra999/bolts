ChangeLog
-=-=-=-=-

Look for the variable "talkername" in bolts.h and change this to the name 
of your talker.

Added a famous quote feature whenever you login.

Increased the buffer size from 15 to 25 lines so that people can write
long profiles and messages if they feel so inclined.

Changed the command prompt from COM> to something more suitable:
Fred@Money Mansion:/home/entrance_lobby>

Prompt is in the format of:
You@Talker name:/home_or_name_of_remote_talker/room_you_are_in>  

Added a space to the emote code so that you won't be emoting like this:

Fred@Money Mansion:/home/entrance_lobby> ;flies around.
Fredflies around.

Added the ability to .tell and .pemote to anyone who is in a netlink.

Modified the .invis ability so that only users your level and higher know that you are 
online. People can .tell, .pemote, .beep, .wake, .cprog, .join (etc.) you if they know you 
are online.

Also, you are able to log on and off invis.  If you are invis, only Admins
and higher can see who you are via the "SIGN ON:" message.

Changed the system messages of .clone and .dest to something more suitable.
Somehow I don't think whispering sharp spells fits into a talker's theme.

Changed the .mode prompt from COM> to Money Mansion> and if you are invis,
it will say Money Mansion (Invis)>

Users with swear words in their name cannot login.

Added a prelogin feature where Wizards and above can see who is logging in.

Added some code at the end of the logout function which tells the user
what site they are logging in from and for how long they were logged in.

Added a few lines in the help_commands function to tell you the number
of commands.

Moved the .semote command to .emoteall and gave it to JrWizzes instead.
Moved the .wizshout command to .wiz

Changed the shortcut keys:

> = .tell
< = .pemote
; = .emote
- = .echo

Erased the NEW level.  If you want it, copy it from Neil's NUTS 3.3.3 code.

Removed helpfiles/mainhelp. Now when you issue the .help command, it will 
tell you the commands available. Less muss, less fuss...

Changed the names of the levels from USER,WIZ,ARCH,GOD,* to
Dunce,User,JrWiz,Wizard,Honor,Admin,God,Creator.  Creator is an extra
level above God and is used for debugging purposes and to demote Gods.  Honor 
is an Admin/God from another talker.  Dunce is for consequencing users if they
break the rules, Dunces can only do .help, .look, .who and .quit.  JrWiz is
a Wizard in training.

Also you can't .delete,.promote,.demote,.ban,.unban,.reboot or .shutdown
over a netlink because of certain security risks involved.  That was a bug
by Neil that I corrected.

07/2002 - Changed the output of 'who' so that people of a level lower than you cannot see 
what room you are in and bug you.

Added the following commands:

User level:

.act - a social command, see .help act for details.

.emergency - an emergency channel to wizards in case the user gets into
	     problems.  The channel is one way only.

.wizzes - gives you a list of Wizards and higher.
For every Wizard you promote, you need to add them to datafiles/wizzes

.staff - tells you a list of the VISIBLE wizards on.

.rules - gives the user a list of rules.
Rules are in the file datafiles/rules

.join - Will take you to the specified person, wherever they are.
        Like if the user's in the corridor and you're elsewhere, they can
        .join Fred for example to get to you.  You can't join someone if
	they're in the wizroom.

.lexamine, .ltell, .lwho will perform .examine, .tell and .who on the home
site if you're netlinked.

.chat - Is a handy dandy chat channel I made loosely based on .shout.
        Usage: .chat <your message>
	.chat on <to turn chat on>
	.chat off <to turn it off>

.uptime - Will show you how long the talker has been up and running.

.time - Will show you the system time.

.roulette - Russian roulette

05/17/01 - Changed the default description of a new user from "a Newcomer" 
to "hasn't used .desc yet"

Wizard level:

Made Wizards able to .clone, .dest, etc.
Changed wizshouts to look like this: 
(Wiz) Fred: wibble

Added the on and off parameters to .wiz so you can turn them on/off
with .wiz on & .wiz off respectively.

.arrest - will arrest someone and toss them in jail if they're bad &
	  keep them in jail even if they .quit...when they are arrested,
	  only .quit and .rules work.
.unarrest - will release them from jail
.beep - will beep someone
.echoall - will echo something to all rooms
.wizemote - will emote something to all wiz
.lpeople - runs .people on the home site if you're netlinked
.lbcast - .bcasts something on the ohme site if you're netlinked.
.bring - brings a user to you.
.force - force anyone below your level to do anything.

Honor level:

.honor - it's an Honor channel
	Usage:  .honor <message>
		.honor on <turns it on>
		.honor off <turns it off>
.honoremote - You can emote on the channel using this.

Admin level:

.admin - it's an Admin channel
        Usage:  .admin <message>         
                .admin on <turns it on>  
                .admin off <turns it off>
.adminemote - Allows you to emote on the channel.

God level:

.god - it's a God channel
        Usage:  .god <message>
                .god on <turns it on>
                .god off <turns it off>
.godemote - You can emote on the channel using this.

That's about it.
