Administrators Guides for NUTS 2.3.0 (as revised by Casey)
----------------------------------------------------------

What can I say?

o Respect user confidentiality

o Make the rules clear and to the point. If they don't exist, don't
  enforce them

o Make a decision on advertising techniques from day one

o Do not promote too many people, you will have to demote some eventually
  if you do (most new administrators promote all their friends)

o When you promote people, make it clear what you expect of them and
  teach them how to do their new job

o Basically have fun, and if you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask other
  talker administrators for guidance
