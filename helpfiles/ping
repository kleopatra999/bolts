Usage: ping <host>

This utility is to ping a host or IP address - to check to see if it is online 
or lagged.

Ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit
an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST datagrams
("pings") have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a ``struct timeval''
and then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.
